    <td>I learnt by trying again if I failed in the stage which I was struggling in and I tried and tried over and over until I got the right solution. This helped me not to give up and get more badges. Other strategies that were effective were asking for help because for some stages it just doesn't click, if you just ask your partner just for a nudge in the right direction. If your friend canâ€™t help ask your teacher because they will always help you.

    <td>Nothing really slowed me down this week because I ignored all distractions like other people and I just worked hard to get more badges on codecadamy and complete my blog. Do not be distracted in lessons and focus on the work so you can talk after your class.</td>
