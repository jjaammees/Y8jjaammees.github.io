    <td>I used my initiative to work out where i went wrong and fixed it by rereading the examples and instructions carefully. When I was really stuck I asked my Partner for helping they explained how everything worked so I understood it. This helped because it meant that when I didn't know something I would end up with the right answer and know how I got there</td>

    <td>Nothing really but I do need to work faster in lessons so I can finish Python. If I worked faster I would be half way through stage two. </td>
