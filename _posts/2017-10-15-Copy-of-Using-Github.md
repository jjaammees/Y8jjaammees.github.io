    <td> Collaboration I worked with my partner, taking it in turns to instruct or work the FUZE box this helped because it meant we could do both and work it out together. We learnt as a team and soon became relatively fluent in FUZE. this was effective because we both got to instruct and construct. We alternate every 10 minutes so we get about 20 minutes of each.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> The fact that we did not know how they worked meant we didn't dare to experiment or our work might stop working and risk our project. We need to start working faster to work our way through the book.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> I will experiment more to find information which i did not know and listen to my partner more to improve how fast we work. I want us to be working fast and to a high standard to achieve the best grade possible. </td>
