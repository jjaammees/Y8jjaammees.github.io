    <td>I learnt with collaboration as I could not have re done the code without my partner. This week our other work from last week didn't save properly so we re did our old work. This took up time and was deeply annoying as it set us off track.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact we were doing work which we had already done beforehand. We could have continued our work If I had not dropped and broken my USB stick so that was another setback so we played with old code again. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We will save our work this lesson. This week has taught me a great lesson that I should not ever forget or lose my USB stick.</td>
