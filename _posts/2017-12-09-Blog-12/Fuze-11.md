  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by listening to instructions and when stuck re-read the part of the book looking for information. This helped because i never got stuck once i had re-read the part of the book. I also learnt by paying attention to instructions. This week we got very far and next week we would like to add more lights.

  <tr>
    <td>The fact that we only had a basic understanding of this section. Apart from that this week went very smoothly and next week we hope to add more lights and make them all flash. This will improve my understanding of the electronics component kit.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>We will add more lights which will hopefully all flash until we are satisfied and have completed an advanced understanding of 'flashing lights'.</td>
