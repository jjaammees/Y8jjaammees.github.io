    <td>I learnt by listening to my teacher and when I got stuck 1) ask my partner for guidance 2) try to figure it out 3) ask my teacher for guidance. If I did not follow that then I would have stalled and that would have disturbed my learning.</td>

    <td>The fact that we had no book to learn from so we had a fine margin of error so it was much harder.</td>
