  <tr>
    <td>I learnt with the strategy of listening to my partner as i got a bit lost in this lesson and so turned to hi for guidance. When my partner did know i asked myself and couldn't figure it out. Luckily my teacher was able to help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that we had no real guidance from the book and took a while to get past each stage without any mistakes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to use my initiative to achieve the work on my own rather than asking for help but of course I will eventually ask the teacher for help otherwise I would not be able to move on. </td>
