    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We were told to delete our old blogs and make new ones so here it is. Also we were told to go on the website called codecademy and start the Python program. This helps us learn the Python code.</td>

    <td>Whenever I got stuck I looked back at the example and the instructions on codecademy and they helped me to complete the tasks set in front of me. So far I have reached 11/14 on stage one. I have learnt the difference between both sets of python code and used them.
Also whenever I got stuck I used my initiative and most of the time I was right. </td>
