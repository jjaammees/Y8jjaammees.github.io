Starting point:</td>
    <td>
last year we made blogs to keep track of are lessons this year we deleted them and created new ones.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>
Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>
To have a Github Pages Static Website</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> 
yes I did as I created my new GitHub blog and I got it working so it showed my posts for instance this one. </td>

How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I listened to the teacher and did everything as told. This helped me create my new blog and get posts working. Another effective strategy was learning from mistakes because at first my blog would not do posts but I managed to get it working.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>
What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
Concentrating on the advice as I didn't do it to a high standard at first but I went on w3schools which helped me with a lot of the code in my blog. It helped me get a table, the right transparency in the boxes and a good background (in my opinion)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I think I need to Listen better in class so I get it right first time round. If you don't listen you make mistakes which will take up more time fixing them then if you did it right the first time around.</td>
  </tr>
