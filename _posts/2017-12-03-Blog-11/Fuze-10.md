  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by listening to instructions and when stuck re-read the part of the book looking for information. This helped because i never got stuck once i had re-read the part of the book. I also learnt by paying attention to instructions</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on making neater figures using the DEFCHAR code. This can be achieved by having a better understanding of the DEFCHAR code. We got cut short as our teacher checked our blogs again and I needed to improve it. So i went to Coding club again to improve my content.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to put the figures is different places on the screen by editing their position. I will try to make neater figures which are more advanced that are harder to make. I can achieve this by concentrating more on the work we are doing rather than the people next to us who are more advanced.</td>
